# DeSSl: A Pytorch toolkit for Deep Semi-supervised learning

## Description

DeSSL is an open source Python toolkit for deep semi-supervised learning.

The toolkit is based on PyTorch with high performance and friendly API.

Our code is pythonic, and the design is consistent with torchvision. You can easily develop new algorithms, or readily apply existing algorithms.

## Installation 

For flexible use and modification, please git clone the library.

## Documentation

You can find the tutorial and API documentation on the website: [DeSSL Documentation](https://ssl-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) .
